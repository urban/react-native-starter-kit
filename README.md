# react-native-starter-kit

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

The most recent version of this guide is available [here](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app/blob/master/react-native-scripts/template/README.md).

## Development

For development, install [React Native
Debugger](https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger#installation). This will replace the default chrome debugger with one that has React and Redux DevTools integration.
